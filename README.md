# Video Utilization Calendar (VUC)

A tool for students check their view progress of multiple course in the semester.

This is a standalone version of the VUC used in production environment for demonstrating the interface and functions. We add a menu with [dat.gui](https://github.com/dataarts/dat.gui) in the upper right corner to show different data.
