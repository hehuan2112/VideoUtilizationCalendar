# Video Utilization Calendar (VUC)

A tool for students to check their viewing progress of multiple courses in one semester.

This is a standalone version of the VUC used in production environment for demonstrating the interface and functions. We host the live demo here: https://hehuan2112.github.io/VideoUtilizationCalendar/

Since the github.io provides static web page service only, the backend of VUC can't be deployed and the data size is limited. We demonstrate this live demo with the data which is used for drawing Figure 2 in our paper.

The screenshot is as follows:
